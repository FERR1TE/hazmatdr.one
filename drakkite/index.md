Animated by dark magic, Drakkite is a stone gargoyle that comes to life in the darkness. He is vicious, agile, flying hunter with a body resistant to most attacks.
During the day, he may perch on the rooftops, wear a cloak to cover himself from the light, or seek refuge somewhere indoors.

Eyes cease to glow when inanimate.

## Strengths
* Surprisingly swift and agile for a creature made of stone, and can fly
* Highly resistant to nonmagical slashing attacks (swords, axes, etc)
* Can become inanimate at will, giving the appearance of an ordinary statue
* Does not need food, air, or sleep, and is as immortal as his stone body allows
* Expert at the game [Moving Statues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statues_(game))

## Weaknesses
* Movement slows and becomes lethargic in light; becomes completely inanimate in daylight (or other broad-spectrum light)
  * Can wear a hood to mitigate the effects of light
* Brittle, thus damage resistance can be bypassed with very heavy bludgeoning or piercing
* Can be temporarily incapacitated with [Dispel Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic) or [Antimagic Field](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/antimagic-field)
* Can't swim
