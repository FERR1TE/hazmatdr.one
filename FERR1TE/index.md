Created as an experimental heavy-duty defense system, FERR1TE's solid steel composition provided excellent endurance. 

Shunned by much of society for what he is, he wanders about looking for those who will accept and care for him.

- He contains a fairly minimal amount of robotics, as his living-metal body is what allows him to move.
- His maw is a furnace capable of melting steel, and as such loves to snack on things made of iron and steel.
- Despite appearances, he tends to act cute and cuddly.
