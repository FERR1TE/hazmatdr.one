#### Fig. 1. Drone collar.
The collar is made of rubber, with a steel electronic buckle.  
The collar initially starts larger, and when applied to the neck, the rubber is retracted into the buckle via a motor, until it is snug on the neck.  
The collar may then be (optionally) heat-treated to permanently fuse it with the rubber drone.
#### Fig. 2. Leash.
Standard leash has matching notches to securely fasten to a matching collar. Automatically puts the wearer into a more docile state.
#### Fig. 3. Attachment.
The leash is attached to the collar via electromagnetism.
#### Fig. 4. Colour codes.
