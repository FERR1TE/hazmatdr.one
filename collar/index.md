#### Fig. 1. Drone collar.
The collar is made of rubber, with a steel electronic buckle.  
The collar initially starts larger, and when applied to the neck, the rubber is retracted into th buckle via a motor, until it is snug on the neck.  
The collar may then be (optionally) heat-treated to permanently fuse it with the rubber drone.
