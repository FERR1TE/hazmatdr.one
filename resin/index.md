## General Info
- **Name**: Resin Drake
- **Species**: Living rubber dragon

Resin is a squeaky, shiny rubber toy dragon, with a bit of a dom lean. Usually he dons black latex shorts which are hard to discern from his black latex body.

- Squeaks a bit as he moves
- Can be very dommy or very subby depending on the mood or individual
