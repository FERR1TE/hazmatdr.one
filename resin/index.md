## General Info
- **Name:** Resin Drake
- **Species:** Living rubber dragon
- **Gender:** Male
- **Orientation:** Gay/grey ace
- **Height:** 170cm *(5'7")*

Resin is a squeaky, shiny living-rubber toy dragon. He usually dons black latex shorts which are hard to discern from his black latex body.

## Notes
- Always wears a collar
- Is usually fairly soft and squishy
- Has a relatively [low melting point](https://www.furaffinity.net/view/26707388/)
- Squeaks a bit as he moves
- Can be very [dommy](https://www.furaffinity.net/view/33994059/) or very [subby](https://www.furaffinity.net/view/19488527/) depending on the mood or individual

- **Don't colourpick from ref!** Use your natural black latex tone.
    - It's a **good** thing if latex gear is about the same tone and texture as him!
