## General Info

- **Species:** Dragonborn *(construct)*
- **Height:** ~6ft *(180cm)*
- **Gender:** Male
- **Orientation:** Gay/ace

- Talus is a dragon capable of shifting his material at will.
- To shift, he must hold a considerable amount of the material in the palm of his hand.
	- He can be forced to shift by forcing material into his hand
- Talus uses mana to stay animate and to shift.
	- Without any supply, he will slowly become inanimate following a logarithmic decay.
	- Some magic users familiar with golemancy may be able to add or remove mana from him.
	- His body is very alchemically potent, and alchemists will have no trouble changing his material.

## Artist Notes
- **Digitigrade**
- His overall design will typically subtly vary depending on his material
